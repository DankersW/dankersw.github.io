                        <h2>A few words about myself</h2>
                        <p>I'm born and raised on the countryside of Belgium, in a small town called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7iAzU7YpKzK7SvMR7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lichtaart</a>.</p>
                        <p>During my studies I was offered the opportunity to study abroad by my lovely parents. After spending a semester in Sweden followed by one in Beijing, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to continue my adventure in Sweden and started a Masters's program in Halmstad Sweden.</p>
                        <p>After my studies I got offered a job and moved to GÃ¶teborg, where I'm still living together with my fantastic partner Mathilda.</p>

                        <p>I very much enjoy tinkering with technology and building projects, but when I'm not sitting behind my computer I'll spend it outside as much as possible regardless of the weather conditions. </p>
                        <p>Some of the activities and sports I do, include alpine & backcountry skiing, ice hockey, rock climbing, trail running, surfing, race cycling, etc. Just to name a few.</p>
